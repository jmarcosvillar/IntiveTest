# Bikes Rental

This was object oriented development.
There is a class Product, for all the products (at this moment only bikes)
The Rental class represents each rental of a product. Its 1-1 with product.
The Promotion class is a promotion, that will have multiples rentals, and apply a promotion to the price of that rentals.
The Mockup class act as service getting hardcoding some parameters that could be getted from a db.
The Sales class is the nearest to the user process, when you create a sale, you are trying to rent a product or multiples to a client. 
	At this moment you only want to add rentals orders of products to your sale, and also add some promotions.
	After you added all the rentals and promotions, you only want to know the total price you will be charging to the client.
